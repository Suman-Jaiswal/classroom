# DRIVE IITI

The central idea of this project is to make the maintenance and 
access of the various study materials needed in the four-year 
curriculum of the students studying in our institute more manageable.
Here, we can store multiple formats of study material for students, 
including but not limited to pdf, png, jpeg, docx, etc. This App 
eliminates the age-old problem that whenever seniors used to give a
link to their drives for a specific material, the link would be
expired after the senior graduates, and their email id is shut down 
by the institution together with their Google Drive.
